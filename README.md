# Abstract:
For our CIS 5450 Final Project, we intend to use a Spotify songs dataset taken from Kaggle in order to analyze what makes a song popular. The data and subjective evaluations are calculated by Spotify and provided via their API. We hope to use Spotify APIâ€™s measurements of various song characteristics to find trends and patterns across popular songs. Our spotify_df contains this data and all collectable statistics such as Loudness, Tempo, Key, Time Signature, Valence, etc. We clean this data, spotify_df_cleaned, so the data is more consistent and our results are more reliable.

Our results are described in more detail in our notebook below. We have an explanation of the motivation behind all visualization and findings in order to show the key takeaways from the data.
